# Stack Overflow Job Search Map

This is a Ruby on Rails app that I have created in order to help find a job.  Jobs are pulled from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/jobs) job search RSS feeds.  City coordinates are from the [geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org/) database. The mapping is done using the [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) mapping library.

Currently the app is a work in progress but it is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) at [http://shrouded-cove-69296.herokuapp.com/stack_jobs/index](http://shrouded-cove-69296.herokuapp.com/stack_jobs/index).


# New Locations

Any city not know by the app will show up near the Bermuda Triangle.  Add an issue for any cities that you see mapped near the Bermuda Triangle.
